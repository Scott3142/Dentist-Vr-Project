# Team 12's Contribution guide

The following is a set of rules that all developers have agreed upon concerning contributing to the project. These rules were created by the team together on Tuesday 13th November. After Monday 19th November the agreement will be locked and no further changes can be made, unless absolutley neccessary.

## The Working Agreement

* All members of the team are required to attend the compulsory uni days on Monday, Tuesday and Friday - Working Days. If you cannot make it on the day for any reasons do let the team know beforehand or arrange a way to still be a part of the stand up in some way .
   
* All members are expected to attend the 10/15 minute daily standup. Daily stand up will occur at 10:30 or earliest convenience on       working days.During the stand-ups each member will inform the team on what they are working on and how its progressing, including any blockers or any issues they have encountered. The team will then try to assist if possible.

* Team members will regularly update the others on their progress via either teams or social media.

* Team members will always meet or communicate on a Thursday to discuss/ make progress before the presentation or the review on the Friday. 

* After the review/presentation on each Friday (End of Sprint), the team will organise the scrum board (On Taiga) for the upcoming Sprint with items from the backlog. TEam members are required to stay until stories and tasks have been assigned and everyone is clear on what they are doing.

* Updates on all group pieces of coursework will be checked on Friday afternoons, immediately after lunch.

* Git is the chosen versioning control tool. The Git branching policy is as follows:
    * Master Branch
    * Development Branch
    * Feature Branches
    
* Individual feature branches will be merged to the development branch at any point throughout the Sprint, but the development branch will only be merged to the master branch on a Thursday. This is so the Sprint is ready for release at the end of each Sprint. 

* In order to merge any work, a pull request must be made and the merge must be approved by another team member.

* Always pull on Git before you push.

* Be honest with each other regarding the performance and contribution, if it comes to that.

* Final commits for a sprint are at 8PM on a Thursday, unless all team members agree or are together.

* All group coursework done using Google Docs. All team members must have the same version of the documents by the end of Friday.

* Non-working days (Wednesday, Thursday, Saturday and Sunday) policy is as follows:
     * Wednesdays for individual work (unless agreed to meet beforehand).
     * Thursday for group work (optional)
     * Saturday/Sunday for work and relaxing/down-time.
     
* Team members must ensure their assigned work is complete by the end of the sprint, but team-members shouldn't push themselves if they have other commitments and make time to relax.
